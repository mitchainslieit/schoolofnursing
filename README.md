School of Nursing (Web based CV Storage)

Notes for 03/22/2018
There are 2 ways to update the cv of a faculty, first option would be creating a new webpage, the second would be creating a modal.
PS. Create a button where if I clicked it it will change the session value like for example is the code below

if(isset($_POST['thisfact']) {
  $_SESSION['email'] = $row[email];
}

This is just an idea of how the code will gonna go or etc. there should be a unique button for each since the table is auto generated, now figure how to make it unique from the others.
